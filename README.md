# Soil Moisture Prediction using Remote Sensing and Soil Texture

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict soil moisture (sm_tgt) using soil texture properties and auxiliary soil moisture data (sm_aux) from remote sensing satellites.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Folder to store model outputs and results.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebooks and scripts in the `notebooks/` and `src/` directories.
